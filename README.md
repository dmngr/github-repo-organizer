# GitHub Repo Organizer

I doubt I'm the only one to have so many GitHub repos that I find them hard to
organize, or even remember all of the stuff I've done. So, I created one more
repo to help me look through my repos, identify which ones have insufficient
metadata (tags, etc), so that I know which ones to look at, label, and
categorize.
